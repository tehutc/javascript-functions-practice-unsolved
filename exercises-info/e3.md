# FUNCTIONS: Early return #

Once the return statement is called in the function body, no other code going beneath will ever be executed.
This becomes really beneficial for loops to return something right away and escape going through the full loop
process.

The function beneath has two return statements:
  * Early return of true in case the if condition is satisfied (becomes true they for any element in the array)
  * Default return of false in case none of the array items conformed the if condition.

```JS
function isNameInTheArray(arr, name) {
  for (let elem of arr) {
    if (elem === name) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

isNameInTheArray(['Andrey', 'Jon', 'James', 'Shawn'], 'Jon'); 
// returns true when the loop gets to the second item of the array immediately.
// 'James' and 'Shawn' item is never reached an called
// which makes it take twice less time to execute the function and return a value.

isNameInTheArray(['Andrey', 'Jon', 'James', 'Shawn'], 'Caleb');
// returns false as there is no Caleb on the list, so the loop has to go over the full array

```

In the exercise e3.js you will be asked to create a function that follows the list: 
  * Makes an early return under some condition
  * Makes a default return
